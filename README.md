🔒 Intrusion Detection System (IDS)

This project is a full-stack machine learning–based Intrusion Detection System designed to identify and classify malicious network activities with high accuracy. It leverages Python, Django, Random Forest Classifier, and visualization tools to provide both real-time intrusion detection and explainability for predictions.

🚀 Key Features:

Attack Classification → Detects and classifies traffic into:

✅ Normal

⚠️ DoS (Denial of Service)

⚠️ Probe

⚠️ R2L (Remote-to-Local)

⚠️ U2R (User-to-Root)

Explainable AI (XAI) → Integrated with SHAP and LIME to interpret model predictions (why an attack was detected).

Frontend → Responsive and user-friendly UI using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript.

Backend → Built on Django with REST API integration for prediction services.

Visualization → Attack graphs showing accuracy metrics and feature importance.

Security Insights → Provides reason for each attack type and recommended precautions for prevention.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Programming Language: Python

Framework: Django

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap

ML Algorithm: Random Forest Classifier (with SHAP & LIME explainability)

Database: SQLite / MySQL

Visualization: Matplotlib, SHAP, LIME

📊 Example Outputs:

Real-time prediction results with attack type, reason, and suggested precautions

SHAP plots (feature impact visualization)

LIME explanations (local model interpretation)

🎯 Project Goal

To build a secure and explainable Intrusion Detection System that not only detects attacks but also helps network administrators understand the cause and take preventive actions.
